## Introduction

Instead of throwing the definitions and theorems straight at your face, we first raise some seemingly trivial but somewhat interesting questions.

1. Is it true that every infinite set has a countable (countably infinite) subset?
2. Is it true that the Cartesian product of any nonempty collection of nonempty sets is nonempty?

For the first question, you may say that hey you are just too stupid. 



[^Russell]: The axiom of choice is needed only when we cannot give an explicit way to make the selection.
[^Bona]: This is a joke. Although the three are mathematically equivalent, many mathematicians find the axiom of choice intuitive, the well-ordering principle counterintuitive, and Zorn's lemma too complex for any intuition. I have the same feeling. :)


Examples:

- The Cartesian product of any nonempty collection of nonempty sets is nonempty.
- Every infinite set has a countable subset.
- There does not exist a perfect notion of measure on $\R$.
- Every vector space has a basis.
- Every finitely generated group possesses maximal subgroups.
