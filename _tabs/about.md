> Philosophy is written in this grand book the universe, which stands continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and to read the alphabet in which it is composed. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one wanders about in a dark labyrinth.

## Hello! I am Zhijie Chen.

I am currently a sophomore undergraduate at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am planning to pursue a minor in mathematics over the next few years.

While my major is in artificial intelligence, I am enthusiastic about mathematics. I am particularly interested in the underlying structure of things --- the rigor of logical reasoning, the intuition behind formal proofs, and the interconnections between theories. This persistent pursuit of clarity and precision often leads me toward abstract thinking and precise formalism, which I find both challenging and rewarding.

## About This Website

As noted in the sidebar, this website hosts a collection of my random thoughts on mathematics and artificial intelligence. I decided to start this blog for two main reasons. The first is to share my knowledge and thoughts with those who may find them helpful. The second is to translate my abstract, flowing thoughts into tangible outputs, thereby deepening my understanding in the process. Although it is really time-consuming, I consider the effort worthwhile.

As for the construction of this website, I might consider writing a separate post about it. Basically, I use Jekyll Chirpy with GitHub Pages and make several customizations, including changing the font to Charter and designing environments for theorems.

## Study Interests and Focus

This section serves as both a self-introduction and a way to hold myself accountable. As you see, I wish to learn so many things. Hopefully I can achieve my goals in the end.
