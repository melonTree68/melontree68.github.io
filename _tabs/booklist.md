## AI-Generated Notes

I sometimes study from notes generated by AI. This approach works particularly well when I want to learn only the rudiments of a subject. All notes below were generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro and lightly edited by me (for typography).

- [*An Introduction to Tensors for the Abstract-Minded*](/assets/notes/An%20Introduction%20to%20Tensors%20for%20the%20Abstract-Minded.pdf)
- [*On the Two Notions of the Tensor Product of Operators*](/assets/notes/On%20the%20Two%20Notions%20of%20the%20Tensor%20Product%20of%20Operators.pdf)
- [*The Foundations of Tensor Algebra*](/assets/notes/The%20Foundations%20of%20Tensor%20Algebra.pdf)
- [*Symmetry and Structure in Tensor Algebra*](/assets/notes/Symmetry%20and%20Structure%20in%20Tensor%20Algebra.pdf)
- [*An Introduction to Generalized Functions (Distributions) and Their Applications*](/assets/notes/An%20Introduction%20to%20Generalized%20Functions%20(Distributions)%20and%20Their%20Applications.pdf)
